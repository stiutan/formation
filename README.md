# Formation
Hello there! If you're reading this, you must be an approved developer who has the ability to work on the Formation application. It is based on a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. You can learn the technologies individually online, but if you just get started on this project, you'll be able to quickly understand all the working gears.

## Getting started
First, you will need to **fork** this repository. **Do not** make direct pushes to this repository. After forking the repository, clone it into your own local environment.
\n
After you have a local copy, we need to use MongoDB locally. If you don't have MongoDB installed, here is a tutorial (for Macs/Unix): https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
After that has been handled, run a local instance of a MongoDB server on a single tab of terminal.
```
mongod
```

After that, open a **new** terminal tab and go into the project's directory. Run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
If everything works, you should be able to see what the project looks like at localhost:3000. You can respecify the port in bin/www, if necessary.

## Contributing

As stated earlier, please fork this repository and **do not** push directly to the repository. If you do, I will have to erase your work and revert back to an earlier commit. Please fork the repository and then send me a push request with modifications!
